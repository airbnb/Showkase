# Showkase

Showkase is an annotation processor based library that helps you organize, discover, search and 
visualize Jetpack Compose components. It magically generates a UI component browser for 
@Composables with very minimal effort. In addition, it also helps you visualize your 
components in common situations like dark mode, RTL layouts, font scaled situations, etc.  

**Benefits**
- Showkase eliminates the manual work needed in maintaining a UI component preview/browser app that 
each ompany/team is forced to build
- Since all the available UI components are now easily searchable and discoverable, there is better 
reuse of the available components. This makes it super useful for maintaining consistency across your app.
The biggest problem for enforcing a design system is discoverability and Showkase hopefully 
solves that problem for your team.
- It allows you to quickly visualize @Composable components as you are building them. The goal is
 to improve the turnaround time in creating a production-ready @Composable component. 
- Showkase aids in catching common UI issues early with the help of autogenerated permutations that
 it renders your components in.


## Installation

Using Showkase is really straightforward and takes less than a couple minutes to get started.

**Step 1**: Add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle` file. If you have a multi-module 
setup, add this dependency to all the modules which have a `@Composable` function that you want to 
display inside the Showkase browser.

```
implementation "com.airbnb:showkase:0.1.0-alpha"
kapt "com.airbnb:showkcase-processor:0.1.0-alpha"
```

**Step 2**: Add the @Showkase annotation to the `@Composable` function/components that should be a 
part of the Showkase browser. 

```
@Showkase(name="Name of component", group="Grouping Name")
```

**Step 3**: Define an implementation of `ShowkaseRootModule` in your root module. If your setup 
involves only a single module, add this implementation in that module. Ensure that this 
implementation is also annotated with the `@ShowkaseRoot` annotation.

```
@ShowkaseRoot
class MyRootModule: ShowkaseRootModule
```

**Step 4**: Showkase is now ready for use! Just start the `ShowcaseBrowserActivity` to access it. 
Typically you would start this activity from the debug menu of your app but you are free to start 
this from any place you like! `ShowcaseBrowserActivity` comes with a nice helper function that 
returns the intent you need to start. Just pass in the context & the `canonicalName` of the root 
module you created in `Step3`.
 

```
startActivity(
    ShowkaseBrowserActivity.getIntent(this, MyRootModule::class.java.canonicalName!!)
)
```
